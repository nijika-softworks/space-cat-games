        <p>
          Hello!
          Development has been on hiatus for a few weeks, but we are back once again!
          Due to complications with those from Starry Systems (claiming they made and owned the Space Cat Games trademark), I had to go on hiatus for a few weeks.

        <p>
          Hello. I have decided to depart from Starry Systems due to personal

        <h2>Version 12 released!</h2>
        <p class="news-date">March 15, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Version 12 has been released to the general public. The changes in
          this version include the removal of things like the RSS Feed, Status
          page and Blooket cheats. This is because they were seen as pointless,
          and took the game parts of the game website away. This version also
          includes the final UI bar, and the gradient has made a return!
