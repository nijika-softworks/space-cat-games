# Space Cat Games - Minimal
The minimal version of Space Cat Games is designed to be deployed on low-spec servers, and used on low-spec machines. Most features that are not game-related have been cut, but at the cost of less updates. It is on the "minimal" branch. Note that this is discontinued, and development has been halted.
